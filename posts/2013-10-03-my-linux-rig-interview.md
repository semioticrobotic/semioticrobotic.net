In August I agreed to an interview about my open source setup and workflow for Steve Ovadia's [My Linux Rig](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/). It appeared [online this week](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/post/62815623115/the-linux-setup-bryan-behrenshausen-academic), and I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.
