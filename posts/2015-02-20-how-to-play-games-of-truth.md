My article, "How to Play Games of Truth," recently appeared in a [special issue](http://www.syllabusjournal.org/syllabus/issue/view/9) of [_Syllabus_](http://www.syllabusjournal.org/) devoted to "teaching with and about video games." Editors Jennifer deWinter and Carly A. Kocurek have assembled an outstanding resource for anyone interested not only in _teaching in_ game studies but also in _using_ games to create unique educational experiences across the curriculum. In keeping with the journal's open access policy, [my article](http://www.syllabusjournal.org/syllabus/article/view/104) is available for [download](http://www.syllabusjournal.org/syllabus/article/view/104/pdf_2) without restriction.
