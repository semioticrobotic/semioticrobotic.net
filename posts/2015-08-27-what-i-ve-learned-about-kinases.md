Recently an email about a new open source genetics research initiative appeared in my university inbox. Two scientists had seen me [riff on open science](http://opensource.com/life/15/7/what-open-science) and thought I might be interested in writing something about the effort.

I was. The resultant article appeared on Opensource.com yesterday as "[For UNC scientists, open source is the way forward](http://opensource.com/life/15/8/unc-scientists-open-source-way-forward)." I really couldn't be happier with the way it turned out.
