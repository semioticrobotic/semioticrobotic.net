My [recent description of the _Mother_ video game franchise](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442278158/100-Greatest-Video-Game-Franchises) represents my most significant attempt (to date) at describing precisely why [I love the games so much](https://opensource.com/life/15/9/EarthBound-video-game). That shot at articulating the ineffable appears in the recently released _100 Greatest Video Game Franchises_ book from Rowan & Littlefield:

> At a time when players and critics alike tend to laud video games for some ability to help players _transcend_ or _project_ or _escape_, _Mother_ reminds us that we are always _right here_, entirely aware of our complex relationship to its quips and quirks, nowhere other than in the midst of the emotional miasma it spins. While seemingly similar games celebrate the spirit of the journey, the joy of striking out, the thrill of leaving behind, _Mother_ recalls the importance of coming home.

The book looks wonderful, and it's [available now](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442278158/100-Greatest-Video-Game-Franchises) (along with its [sister volume](http://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442278127/100-Greatest-Video-Game-Characters)).
