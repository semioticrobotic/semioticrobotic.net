Today Opensource.com [published my reflection](https://opensource.com/life/16/5/19-years-later-cathedral-and-bazaar-still-moves-us) on _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_, which I wrote in honor of the document's 19th anniversary:

> Whether Raymond's insights hold true—whether they "accurately" describe the contemporary political, social, and economic conditions for open source _anything_—are inconsequential in light of the way _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_ actually _functions_ today. Quite simply, what the book says is not nearly as important as what it _does_.
