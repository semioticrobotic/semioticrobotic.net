[Scott Nesbitt](https://scottnesbitt.net/), proprietor of the excellent and indispensable _Plain Text Project_, has published [an interview with me](https://plaintextproject.online/2018/12/05/Behrenshausen.html). We discuss my writing and editing habits, my tool preferences, and my plain-by-default workflow.

I'm aware of no other place on the web that would grant me such room to explain my plain-text writing penchant in crushing detail. But I'm sure glad it exists. And I'm glad Scott's running it.

On a related note: I suppose I should document here my current plain-text writing setup (since it's changed since the interview and will inevitably change again).

I recently rehabilitated my beloved ThinkPad X220 and have installed [Fedora 29 Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/) on it. It's now my dedicated writing machine, and to that end I've customized it with the following software:

- i3 (for window management)
- nano (for general text editing)
- ghostwriter (for markdown text editing)
- wordgrinder (for all-purpose writing)
- aiksaurus (for lightweight reference)
- proselint (for editing help and inspiration)
- w3m (for reading remote files with minimal interruption)

No environment is "distraction-free" (have you seen my desk?), but this gets me as close as I could hope to be.
